Mako Bates is currently a graduate assistant in [the PLAID Lab](https://plaid.w3.uvm.edu/) at the University of Vermont.
He's studying language design, secure multi-party computation, and differential privacy systems.
On Github he is [ShapeOfMatter](https://github.com/ShapeOfMatter).

He put [the 402-Receipts Standard](https://www.402receipts.info/introduction.html) on indefinite hiatus in 2019. 
Of that work, the piece mostly likely to still be of any use is the [RSA Blind Signature](https://github.com/ShapeOfMatter/RSA-Blind-Signature) implementation.

Mako built a deep understanding of php and python during his six years of industry work; this inspired his decision to return to academia.
